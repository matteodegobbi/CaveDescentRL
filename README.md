# Cave Descent with Deep Reinforcement Learning 

This project was carried out for [HackUPC 2025](https://hackupc-2025.devpost.com/).
It is a simple side-scroller game environment designed for training reinforcement learning agents, using a deep Q-learning approach to validate the agent's performance in a dynamically generated terrain.

## Usage

Execute the following commands to **run** the learned agent:
```shell
python rocket.py --run
```

To **play** the game yourself, run the following command:
```shell
python rocket.py --human
```

**Training** can be started with
```shell
python rocket.py --train
```
